Create points, lines and polygons. Splitting with line processing algorithm and QgsExpressions to populate fields
Create points, specify coordinate reference system, add fields and set attributes.
Add features and set geometry using QgsPointXY
create lines and polygon
use algorithm:split with lines to split a polygon using a line
populate fields using expressions
use for loops
